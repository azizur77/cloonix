Build and install from github sources:
--------------------------------------

         git clone https://github.com/clownix/cloonix.git
         cd cloonix
         ./install_depends build
         ./doitall

  For each distribution, packets have to be installed for the build,
  a script has been written for this task, look into the
  install_depends file and launch it as root with build as input
  parameter.
  
  Then then a call to ./doitall does the build, pack and install of the 
  binaries in /usr/local/bin.
  Note that the "sudo" in the doitall is there to give the root
  privileges to be able to write in the /usr/local/bin where cloonix
  is installed.

  If you do not have sudo or are not in the sudoers, you must be root
  to call: ./install_cloonix cloonix-${VERSION}.tar.gz

  Be aware that cloonix_config must be saved because it is overwritten
  with each new install.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Install from already compiled binaries found at cloonix.fr:
-----------------------------------------------------------

         wget http://cloonix.fr/archive/v-33-01/jessie-cloonix-33-01.tar.gz
         wget http://cloonix.fr/archive/v-33-01/install_depends
         wget http://cloonix.fr/archive/v-33-01/install_cloonix
         ./install_depends run
         ./install_cloonix jessie-cloonix-33-01.tar.gz

  To run the pre-compiled software, the host needs a subset of the packets
  needed for the build, the script used for the build:
  install_depends can be launched with run as input to install the
  sub-set needed for the run. It must be run with root privilege.


To use the software, a virtual machine qcow2 is necessary:
----------------------------------------------------------
       
         wget http://cloonix.fr/bulk_stored/jessie.qcow2.xz
         mv jessie.qcow2.xz ${HOME}/cloonix_data/bulk
         cd ${HOME}/cloonix_data/bulk
         xz -d jessie.qcow2.xz

  After the install, download one of the virtual machines provided at
  cloonix.fr, choose the jessie.qcow2, and put it in your "bulk" directory,
  see in /usr/local/bin/cloonix/cloonix_config the path for the bulk
  directory which is by default ${HOME}/cloonix_data/bulk. 
  
Use a demo script to begin using cloonix:
-----------------------------------------

         wget http://cloonix.fr/demo_stored/ping.sh
         chmod +x ping.sh 
         ./ping.sh

  Download one of the demo scripts provided at cloonix.fr, choose the 
  "ping.sh" script because it is the simplest one and launch it.
  



NOTE:
-----
  To use the sniffer, you must install wireshark-qt on the machine
  hosting the cloonix server.
